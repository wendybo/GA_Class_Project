# GA_Class_Project

This is my Data Science Project.

I want to discover if I can predict player rankings based on player stats across a season in the NFL.
I will be using NFL data from: https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb
So far, I don't know much about the data but plan to dig into it more (12/12/2017)
I chose this topic because I'm tired of losing in fantasy football. There's always next year.
